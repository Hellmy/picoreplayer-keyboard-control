# Use a keyboard to control the picoreplayer
I wanted to use the num keys to control the picoreplayer. Therfore you have to install the "setleds" package.
Add ```setleds -D +num``` in .ashrc, so num-lock is already turned on during first login to console which is done automaticly during boot.

# Usage
After initial setup you can remap keys to something similar as in ashrc-add perhaps you will also need the other scripts. The scripts must be adapted through changes of ```picoreplayer-name``` and ```lms-ip``` your network configurations.
